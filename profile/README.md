# Syntax Script
> A scripting language designed by you.

Syntax Script is designed to be a language where you set the rules. I'm not joking, there is literally a `rule` keyword to let you change any rule. You can create any kind of syntax you want, and work with it. Syntax Script doesn't have a runtime, you have to compile it into other languages. This allows you to write once, run everything.
